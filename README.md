# Element Enhancer

## Element Enhancer for Svelte

There are a tun of different element libraries out there, and I have used a fare share of them throughout some of the projects I've worked on. For some reason, I was never really satisfied with how they worked. Normally everything worked, but in some cases I couldn't seem to get it to work the way I wanted, and had to come up with hacky solutions.

This is just a fun project where I try to tackle the challenges and test if I can come up with a good solution
